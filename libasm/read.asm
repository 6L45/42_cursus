; read a character from stdin and store it in the specified memory location

; inputs:
;   RDI: pointer to the memory location where the read character should be stored

; outputs:
;   RAX: the number of bytes read (should be 1 if successful, 0 if EOF, or -1 if an error occurred)

read:
  ; call the read syscall to read a single character from stdin
  mov rax, 0    ; set syscall number to 0 (sys_read)

  mov rdx, 1    ; set the number of bytes to read
  syscall       ; make the syscall

  ; check the return value in RAX to see if the read was successful
  cmp rax, 1    ; check if RAX is equal to 1
  jne .error    ; jump to the error handling code if the read was unsuccessful

  ; return the number of bytes read (should be 1 if successful)
